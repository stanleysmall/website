<h1>
Inference
</h1>

<p>
Inference can often be explained as an "if - else" condition. Rigorous logical inference rules have existed since the days of Aristote. With the addition of uncertainty, one can represent inference rules as conditional probababilities. The Bayesean approach to probability allows one to find a posterior distribution given a prior distribution and some evidence. While a variety of methods used to represent uncertainty exist, one can refer to <cite>cheeseman1985defense</cite>.

Inference allows machines to deduce new facts or to update beliefs (in the form of a probability) based on evidence. In learning the rules which allows machines to behave, we are one step closer to "learning the rules".
